    <h3><i>Inspiring students to pursue careers in engineering, science, technology, and mathematics through robotics
        design...</i></h3>
    <p>BEST Robotics is one of the most exciting parts of the school year for students at Bryan Collegiate High School.
        Our school does not have traditional extra-curicular activities. Students focus mostly on college classes and
        college preperation. Having a competition like BEST really allows us to explore a path that is not offered to
        every student. It allows us to be creative and to grow our skills in fields like programming, engineering, and
        architecture. We all put our heart and soul into what we do and we have fun doing it. BEST robotics really
        brings our small school together and gives us some of the challenges that we seek as students.</p>

    <p> This years BEST competition "Current Events" is a very difficult challenge to climb. Not only does our robot
        build team have a new dimension to think about with the robot being suspended in the air, but the topic of ocean
        clean up is one that is on the minds of many people around the world. Keeping our water sources and oceans clean
        of trash and debree is something that we all want, and it is a wonderful thing to think that we, as a team, are
        helping the cause with our own ideas and creativity.</p>
    <p> Even though we are not able to easily access the ocean to help the cause, we do have our own watersource in Lake
        Bryan. With this in mind we set out to do our part and spent a day cleaning up trash from around the beaches and
        camp sites of our beautiful lake.</p>
